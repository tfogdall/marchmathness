        <h1>HOW IS MARCH MATHNESS FORMATTED?</h1>
        <p>
          March Mathness has four rounds running from March 11, 2026 to the championship round on
          April 8, 2026. The second, third, and final rounds are formatted differently than the opening
          round, so read on to find out more. (NOTE: The 2025 event was held at Eagle High School, so 
          all linked documents are labeled as such.)
        </p>
          <h2>Round 1 - Initial Seeding - March 11, 2026</h2>
        <p>
          Round 1 must be a different format to allow for large numbers of teams, so it ultimately serves
          as a seeding round. 2025's Round 1 was themed, "Are you smarter than a fifth-grader" and consisted 
          of <a href="documents/EHS_March_Madness_Round_One.pdf" target="_blank">a ten-question quiz of fifth-grade topics</a>, (although the questions were still designed to be
          very difficult to prevent teams from all earning perfect scores.) Turn-in order was used to break 
          ties. (NOTE: The 2026 theme will be announced as the event nears, but participants can expect a structure
          that will allow the top eight teams to move on to Round 2.)

        <h2><a href="documents/EHS_March_Madness_Elite_Eight.pdf" target="_blank">Round 2 - Elite Eight - March 15, 2026</a></h2>
        <h2><a href="documents/EHS_March_Madness_Final_Four.pdf" target="_blank">Round 3 - Final Four - April 1, 2026</a></h2>
        <h2>Round 4 - March Mathness Championship - April 8, 2026</h2>
        <p>
          Rounds 2 and 3, the Elite Eight & Final Four, were both open-ended problem-solving in 2025. Both 
          exercise sets are provided. The championship round in 2025 was a round of Jeopardy. Like the seeding
          round, however, expect themes to be announced as March Mathness nears.
