        <h1>WHAT IS MARCH MATHNESS??</h1>
        <p>
          March Mathness is a single-elimination mathematics tournament/festival inspired 
          by the NCAA basketball tournaments and is held in March and April of each year. The 
          event's primary goal is to foster and encourage collaborative problem-solving with
          a focus on simply having fun for 
          <strong>students of all mathematical backgrounds.</strong> To accomplish the goal of 
          making the event accessible to all, exercises are largely drawn from an area of
          mathematics called discrete mathematics, which usually requires very little prior
          knowledge to participate. Long story short: Students without advanced algebraic 
          training are encouraged to participate!
